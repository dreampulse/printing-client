# Printing Engine Client

Frontend Application for the Printing Engine

## Requirements

To build and run the source code you need to install a recent version of [Node.js, NPM](https://nodejs.org/).

## Project setup

Run the command `npm install` in the root of the project folder to install all required dependencies.

## NPM commands

There are various commands available via NPM for use during development and to create a production build of the source code.

- `npm run build`: Build the production version of the source code into `/dist`.
- `npm run start:dev`: Start a development server with the development build of the source code on Port `3000`.
- `npm run start:styleguide` : Starts the Component testing app.
- `npm run start` : Starts a production webserver with the distribution build.
- `npm run start:dev` : Starts a development server with hot reloading.
- `npm run start:dev:stubs` : Starts a development server with hot reloading and stubs the API.
- `npm run start:styleguide` : Starts react storybook.
- `npm run test`: Lint the source code and run all available tests cases (unit tests, integration tests and e2e tests).
- `npm run test:coverage`: Run unit and integration tests and collect coverage Information.
- `npm run test:dev:watch`: Run unit tests in watch mode.
- `npm run changes`: Show current changes which will go into next release.
- `npm run release [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | prerelease]`: Create a new release by increasing the version number. Changelog is generated automatically from pull requests.

## Start Dist Build

To start the application from the `/dist` folder do the following:

~~~
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
~~~

## Terminology
- Services: Services are JS modules which can be found in `/src/app/service`. They wrap external dependencies (e.g. DOM, external libs) which we don't want to include in the unit tests.
- Libs: Libs are our own libraries which contain the core business logic. They can be found in `/src/app/lib`.

## Dependency Injection
We don't use a explicit dependency injection model. We use ES6-Module export and `sinon.stub()` for testing instead.
Be aware that `sinon.stub()` only stubs methods not other object properties. If you want to stub all object properties you
have to use `sinon.sandbox.create()`.

## CSS
SASS is our CSS preprocessor of choice.
Use [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) to structure your CSS. Deep nesting should be prevented.
Colors should be semantic. Therefore, use Sass variables for design-specific colors.
Use variables and comments to explain 'magic numbers'.

## Tests
Linter and tests are executed with `npm run test`.
Use `npm test:coverage` for checking the test coverage via [`istanbul`](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul).

The following folders are unit tested and should have 100% test coverage:
- `/src/app/action`
- `/src/app/reducer`
- `/src/app/lib`

React components (`/src/app/component`) and containers (`/src/app/container`) are not automatically tested the reviewer is responsible to test them carefully manually.

## Definition of Done

- The code of a new pull request (PR) does at least what is defined in the ticket and does not affect any other functionality
- The PR has a meaningful title
- There is a link to the issue-id
- The PR has been reviewed
- There are no 'hacks' or shortcuts refactoring is preferred

###	Testability
- All exported functions are testable
- Default exports are avoided
- The code is concise, expressive and readable
- The code is functional and doesnâ€™t use class syntax

### React components are
- Are stateless
- Use pure rendering functions
- Are documented and tested in storybook
- Typed-checked
- The Sass is strictly using the BEM-Convention
- For each React component, there is only one Sass file
- There is no container styled
- There are no console errors or unwanted console logs

## Workflow
1. The implementer has to discuss the solution strategy with the most experienced developer(s) of the project. They have to approve the strategy and provide helpful feedback.  
1. The implementer of a bugfix / new feature creates a pull request (PR) in github.
1. The implementer adds a reviewer to the pull request when the implementation is done.
  - The reviewer is selected by the implementer.
  - The reviewer is added to the list of **reviewers** and **assignees**.
  - The label `needs review` is added to the pull request.
1. The reviewer reviews the PR and adds comments for each known issue.
  - The reviewer has to update the label to `needs fixing` and to change the **assignees** to the implementer.
  - If there are no issues left the reviewer **and only him** has to merge the PR to the `master`.
1. If there are still open issues the implementer **and only him** has to fix them.
  - Fixed issues have to be marked by using the :+1:-emoji.
  - If an issue isn't fixable or unjustified a reasonable comment has to be provided.
  - The implementer has to update the label to `need review` again and to change the **assignees** to the reviewer.
  - Repeat the preview step.
